# Roadmap

## Phase 1 (v0.1.0):

- [ ] Create a basic controller that supports PID control.
- [ ] Implement a configuration system so that the controller parameters can be adjusted.
- [ ] Adding profiling/benchmarking/sanitizers.
- [ ] Implement protobuf messages for communicating with the game engine.
- [ ] Implement a client-server architecture for communication between the controller and the game engine over a local port.

## Phase 2 (v0.2.0):

- [ ] Add crosscompilation support for Raspberry Pi.
- [ ] Add support for additional control strategies.
- [ ] Add support for switching controllers at compile time.
- [ ] Implement additional protobuf messages for communicating with the game engine.
- [ ] Add support for more complex interactions between the controller and the game engine.

## Phase 3 (v0.3.0):

- [ ] Add support for multiple controllers in a single system.
- [ ] Add support for logging and monitoring controller performance.
- [ ] Implement additional protobuf messages for communicating with the game engine.
- [ ] Add support for more complex interactions between the controllers and the game engine.

## Phase 4 (v0.4.0):

- [ ] Add support for distributed control.
- [ ] Add support for complex control strategies, such as adaptive control and predictive control.
- [ ] Implement additional protobuf messages for communicating with the game engine.
- [ ] Add support for more complex interactions between the controllers and the game engine.

## Phase 5 (v0.5.0):

Add additional features and polish, such as a user interface (if available), documentation, and tests.
